# hello-world

Hello All,

My name is Keelen Wolfe and I am a student at the University of Oregon. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Business and Economics as well as minoring in Computer Information Technology and Media Studies. I love music, especially hip-hop, and practice playing my guitar every day as well as creating new songs in Logic Pro X. One day I hope to work in the music industry, and although I'm not sure as what yet I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.
